### Important notes:
The overview is typically the first section of API documentation. Generally found at the beginning of the doc, it will provide a high-level introduction to how to connect and use the API. In addition, it could contain information about authentication and rate-limiting. 

Review the documentation for functionality, or the actions that you can take using the given API. These will be represented by a combination of an HTTP method (GET, PUT, POST, DELETE) and an endpoint. Every organization’s APIs will be different, but you can expect to find functionality related to user account management, options to upload and download data, different ways to request information, and so on.

When making a request to an endpoint, make sure you note the request requirements. Requirements could include some form of authentication, parameters, path variables, headers, and information included in the body of the request. The API documentation should tell you what it requires of you and mention which part of the request that information belongs in. If the documentation provides examples, use them to help you. Typically, you can replace the example values with the ones you’re looking for. The table below describes some of the conventions often used in these examples.
