The **Printer Bug** is an NTLM relay vulnerability in Windows that exploits the **MS-RPRN (Remote Print System)** interface. It forces a computer to authenticate to another system via NTLM by tricking it into connecting to a fake printer share.

#### Key Steps in the Printer Bug Exploit:

1. An attacker tricks a target system into initiating an SMB connection to their controlled system (e.g., via `MS-RPRN`).
2. The target system sends an **NTLM authentication request**, which can then be relayed or captured for further use.

#### Example Exploit Code:

Using a tool like `impacket-rprnrelay` to trigger the Printer Bug:

### **Setting Up Resource-Based Constrained Delegation (RBCD)**

RBCD allows you to configure which accounts or computers can impersonate other users to access a resource. By combining RBCD with the Printer Bug, you can redirect delegation privileges from a legitimate computer to one you control.

- **Gain Write Access to the Target Resource's Delegation Attribute**:
  - Find a computer object in AD where you have control (e.g., through a compromised machine or account).
  - Modify the `msDS-AllowedToActOnBehalfOfOtherIdentity` attribute of the target computer to include your controlled computer object.
- **Abuse Printer Bug to Authenticate to the Target**:
  - Trigger the Printer Bug on the target computer to force it to authenticate to your controlled computer.
- **Relay Authentication**:
      - Relay the NTLM authentication from the target to your controlled computer.
      - At this point, your controlled computer has a Kerberos Service Ticket that allows it to impersonate users to the target computer.
