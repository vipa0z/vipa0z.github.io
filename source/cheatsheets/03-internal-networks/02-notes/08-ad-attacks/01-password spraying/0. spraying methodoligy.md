## Identifying Users

To mount a successful password spraying attack, we first need a list of valid domain users to attempt to authenticate with. There are several ways that we can gather a target list of valid users:

if we do not know the password policy, `we can always ask our client`, and, if they won't provide it, we can either try one very targeted password spraying attempt as a "hail mary" if all other options for a foothold have been exhausted.
`we must always keep a log of our activities, including, but not limited to:`
- The accounts targeted
- Domain Controller used in the attack
- Time of the spray
- Date of the spray
- Password(s) attempted
