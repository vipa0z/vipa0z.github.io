## Unquoted Service Path

When a service is installed, the registry configuration specifies a path to the binary that should be executed on service start. If this binary is not encapsulated within quotes, Windows will attempt to locate the binary in different folders. Take the example binary path below.

```shell-session
C:\Program Files (x86)\System Explorer\service\SystemExplorerService64.exe
```

Windows will decide the execution method of a program based on its file extension, so it's not necessary to specify it. Windows will attempt to load the following potential executables in order on service start, with a .exe being implied:

- `C:\Program`
- `C:\Program Files`
- `C:\Program Files (x86)\System`
- `C:\Program Files (x86)\System Explorer\service\SystemExplorerService64`

#### Querying Service

```cmd-session
C:\htb> sc qc SystemExplorerHelpService

[SC] QueryServiceConfig SUCCESS

SERVICE_NAME: SystemExplorerHelpService
        TYPE               : 20  WIN32_SHARE_PROCESS
        START_TYPE         : 2   AUTO_START
        ERROR_CONTROL      : 0   IGNORE
        BINARY_PATH_NAME   : C:\Program Files (x86)\System Explorer\service\SystemExplorerService64.exe
        LOAD_ORDER_GROUP   :
        TAG                : 0
        DISPLAY_NAME       : System Explorer Service
        DEPENDENCIES       :
        SERVICE_START_NAME : LocalSystem
```

If we can create the following files, we would be able to hijack the service binary and gain command execution in the context of the service, in this case, `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`.

- `C:\Program.exe\`
- `C:\Program Files (x86)\System.exe`

However, creating files in the root of the drive or the program files folder requires administrative privileges. Even if the system had been misconfigured to allow this, the user probably wouldn't be able to restart the service and would be reliant on a system restart to escalate privileges. Although it's not uncommon to find applications with unquoted service paths, it isn't often exploitable.

#### Searching for Unquoted Service Paths

We can identify unquoted service binary paths using the command below.

```cmd-session
C:\htb> wmic service get name,displayname,pathname,startmode |findstr /i "auto" | findstr /i /v "c:\windows\\" | findstr /i /v """
GVFS.Service                                                                        GVFS.Service                              C:\Program Files\GVFS\GVFS.Service.exe                                                 Auto
System Explorer Service                                                             SystemExplorerHelpService                 C:\Program Files (x86)\System Explorer\service\SystemExplorerService64.exe             Auto
WindscribeService                                                                   WindscribeService                         C:\Program Files (x86)\Windscribe\WindscribeService.exe                                  Auto
```
