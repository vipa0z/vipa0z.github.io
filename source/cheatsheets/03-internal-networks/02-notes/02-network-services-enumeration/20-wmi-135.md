# wmi `TCP` port `135
`
for the administration and remote maintenance of Windows computers

Windows Management Instrumentation (`WMI`) , core functionality of the standardized Web-Based Enterprise Management (`WBEM`) 


# Tools that use wmi
Wmiexec.py utilizes a semi-interactive shell where commands are executed through [Windows Management Instrumentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/wmisdk/wmi-start-page). It does not drop any files or executables on the target host and generates fewer logs than other modules. After connecting, it runs as the local admin user we connected with (this can be less obvious to someone hunting for an intrusion than seeing SYSTEM executing many commands). This is a more stealthy approach to execution on hosts than other tools, but would still likely be caught by most modern anti-virus and EDR systems. We will use the same account as with psexec.py to access the host.

```bash
wmiexec.py blackwood.local/wley:'transporter@4'@172.16.5.5  
```
