tools: onesixtyone braa snmpwalk
**snmpwalk** in case of misconfiguration allowing querying

- query for getting all OIDs

```shell-session
$ snmpwalk -v2c -c public 10.129.14.128
#output -> iso.3.6.1.2.1.1.1.0 = STRING: "Linux htb 5.11.0-34-generic #36~20.04.1-Ubuntu SMP Fri Aug 27 08:06:32 UTC 2021 x86_64"
```

\*\*onesixtyone brute community string

```shell-session
$ onesixtyone -c /opt/useful/seclists/Discovery/SNMP/snmp.txt 10.129.14.128
```

when certain community strings are bound to specific IP addresses, they are named with the hostname of the host, and sometimes even symbols are added to these names to make them more challenging to identify. However, if we imagine an extensive network with over 100 different servers managed using SNMP, the labels, in that case, will have some pattern to them

We can use the tool [crunch](https://secf00tprint.github.io/blog/passwords/crunch/advanced/en) to create custom wordlists Once we know a community string, we can use it with [braa](https://github.com/mteg/braa) to brute-force the individual OIDs and enumerate the information behind

after finding community with crunch and onesixtyone use braa to get OID info
[braa](https://github.com/mteg/braa) to brute-force the individual OIDs and enumerate the information behind them.
bra get OID info

```shell-session
braa <community string>@<IP>:<.1.3.6.*>
