# when landing on a system ask yourself
 what is this system used for? who owns it..
`What might an IT admin be doing on a day-to-day basis and which of those tasks may require credentials?`

We can use this question and consideration to refine our search to reduce the need for random guessing as much as possible.

#### Key terms to search for

Whether we end up with access to the GUI or CLI, we know we will have some tools to use for searching but of equal importance is what exactly we are searching for. Here are some helpful key terms we can use that can help us discover some credentials:

- Passwords
- Passhrases
- Keys
- Username
- User account
- Creds
- Users
- Passkeys
- configuration
- dbcredential
- dbpassword
- pwd
- Login
- Credentials
Note:** Web browsers are some of the most interestings placed to search for credentials, due to the fact that many of them offer built-in credential storage. In the most popular browsers, such as `Google Chrome`, `Microsoft Edge`, and `Firefox`, stored credentials are encrypted. However, many tools for decrypting the various credentials databases used can be found online, such as [firefox_decrypt](https://github.com/unode/firefox_decrypt) and [decrypt-chrome-passwords](https://github.com/ohyicong/decrypt-chrome-passwords). LaZagne supports `35` different browsers on Windows.

 Here are some other places we should keep in mind when credential hunting:

- Passwords in Group Policy in the SYSVOL share
- Passwords in scripts in the SYSVOL share
- Password in scripts on IT shares
- Passwords in `web.config` files on dev machines and IT shares
- Password in `unattend.xml`
- Passwords in the AD user or computer description fields
- KeePass databases (if we are able to guess or crack the master password)
- Found on user systems and shares
- Files with names like `pass.txt`, `passwords.docx`, `passwords.xlsx` found on user systems, shares, and [Sharepoint](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/sharepoint/collaboration)
