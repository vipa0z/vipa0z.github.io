# commands:

using unshadow
It works by combining the `passwd` and `shadow` files into a single file suitable for cracking.

```shell-session
$ sudo cp /etc/passwd /tmp/passwd.bak
$ sudo cp /etc/shadow /tmp/shadow.bak
$ unshadow /tmp/passwd.bak /tmp/shadow.bak > /tmp/unshadowed.hashes
```

This "unshadowed" file can now be attacked with either JtR or hashcat.

```shell-session
$ hashcat -m 1800 -a 0 /tmp/unshadowed.hashes rockyou.txt -o /tmp/unshadowed.cracked
```

with john but i havent tested:

```
john --signle /etc/shaddow <File>
```

# Overview

hunting for creds
Usually, we will find the value `x` in this field, indicating that the passwords are stored in a hashed form within the `/etc/shadow` file. However, it can also be that the `/etc/passwd` file is writeable by mistake. This would allow us to remove the password field for the `root` user entirely.

```shell-session
$ head -n 1 /etc/passwd

root::0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
```

This results in no password prompt being displayed when attempting to log in as `root`.

```shell-session
$ su
```

## shadow file

The `/etc/shadow` file is also only readable by users with administrative privileges. The format of this file is divided into the following `nine fields`:

```shell-session
vipa0z:$y$j9T$3QSBB6CbHEu...SNIP...f8Ms:18955:0:99999:7:::
```

privileges. The format of this file is divided into the following `nine fields`:

Linux Authentication Process

```shell-session
vipa0z:$y$j9T$3QSBB6CbHEu...SNIP...f8Ms:18955:0:99999:7:::
```

| Field             | Value                              |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Username          | `vipa0z`                      |
| Password          | `$y$j9T$3QSBB6CbHEu...SNIP...f8Ms` |
| Last change       | `18955`                            |
| Min age           | `0`                                |
| Max age           | `99999`                            |
| Warning period    | `7`                                |
| Inactivity period | `-`                                |
| Expiration date   | `-`                                |
| Reserved field    | `-`                                |

If the `Password` field contains a character such as `!` or `*`, the user cannot log in using a Unix password. However, other authentication methods—such as Kerberos or key-based authentication—can still be used. The same applies if the `Password` field is empty, meaning no password is required for login.

This can lead to certain programs denying access to specific functions.

The `Password` field also follows a particular format, from which we can extract additional information:

- `$<id>$<salt>$<hashed>`
  As we can see here, the hashed passwords are divided into three parts. The `ID` value specifies which cryptographic hash algorithm was used, typically one of the following:

| ID     | Cryptographic Hash Algorithm                                          |
| ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `1`    | [MD5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5)                              |
| `2a`   | [Blowfish](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blowfish_(cipher)>)         |
| `5`    | [SHA-256](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2)                        |
| `6`    | [SHA-512](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2)                        |
| `sha1` | [SHA1crypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1)                      |
| `y`    | [Yescrypt](https://github.com/openwall/yescrypt)                      |
| `gy`   | [Gost-yescrypt](https://www.openwall.com/lists/yescrypt/2019/06/30/1) |
| `7`    |                                                                       |

Many Linux distributions, including Debian, now use `yescrypt` as the default hashing algorithm. On older systems, however, we may still encounter other hashing methods that can potentially be cracked.

## Opasswd

The PAM library (`pam_unix.so`) can prevent users from reusing old passwords. These previous passwords are stored in the `/etc/security/opasswd`

```shell-session
$ sudo cat /etc/security/opasswd

cry0l1t3:1000:2:$1$HjFAfYTG$qNDkF0zJ3v8ylCOrKB0kt0,$1$kcUjWZJX$E9uMSmiQeRh4pAAgzuvkq1
```

# CRACKING LINUX CREDS

using unshadow
It works by combining the `passwd` and `shadow` files into a single file suitable for cracking.

```shell-session
$ sudo cp /etc/passwd /tmp/passwd.bak
$ sudo cp /etc/shadow /tmp/shadow.bak
$ unshadow /tmp/passwd.bak /tmp/shadow.bak > /tmp/unshadowed.hashes
```

This "unshadowed" file can now be attacked with either JtR or hashcat.

```shell-session
$ hashcat -m 1800 -a 0 /tmp/unshadowed.hashes rockyou.txt -o /tmp/unshadowed.cracked
