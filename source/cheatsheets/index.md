        A collection of my penetration testing notes and cheatsheets covering vulnerability discovery in Web Apps, APIs, Internal networks, and Active Directory.

    <p class="welcome-description">
        Heads up! These notes are for CTF challenges and authorized pentests only. Don't be a dick and go attack random sites - seriously, keep it legal and ethical. Use your powers for good (or at least for flags).
