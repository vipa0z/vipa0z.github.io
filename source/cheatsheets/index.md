        A collection of my penetration testing notes and cheatsheets covering a wide range
        of topics (mainly vulnerability discovery in AD & Internal networks, Blackbox Web
        App Security testing, API Security testing and the OWASP TOP 10)
        compiled from
        Complete CPTS, CWES (minus web fuzzing/broken auth),
        PortSwigger Academy, API University,
        personal research, and various sources such as Ippsec, Hacktricks, Payloads All The
        Things,
        and
        various labs. Use the sidebar to navigate.
