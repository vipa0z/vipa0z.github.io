## Thanks for being here!

I’m vipa0z, an offensive security specialist passionate about red teaming and finding creative ways to make systems behave badly (for a good cause, of course).

Ever since I was a kid, I was drawn to anything that felt mysterious or “unfairly powerful.” I’d lose myself for hours in the Mega Man Zero and MOBA shooters like Overwatch. I was obsessed with mastering every mechanic and uncovering cool attacks, tricks, and hidden upgrades Around the same time, I discovered game cheats and it felt like pure black magic. I genuinely believed there were digital sorcerers behind the scenes rewriting the rules of reality from the shadows.

That fascination with breaking systems and finding hidden paths evolved into a passion for understanding how things really work beneath the surface.
That drive naturally led me into exploit development and professional offensive security.

## My Approach

My philosophy? Simple: nothing is secure, everything is suspicious, and there’s always a deeper layer to peel back. I focus on practical techniques that work in real-world scenarios, not just proof-of-concepts that look good on paper. What’s that? It doesn’t work? It was working when I exploited it. EZ

## What will you find in my blog?

Welcome to the chaos. This is where I document my journey through exploitation, red teaming, and the occasional *“I have no idea why this worked, but I’ll take it and then figure out why”* moment.

Whether you're here to learn, laugh, or just steal my payload syntax...welcome. I break things so you don’t have to (or so you can, but more efficiently).
