Thanks for being here!
I’m vipa00, an offensive security specialist passionate about red teaming, malware development, and low-level system exploitation.

Ever since I was a kid, I was drawn to anything that felt mysterious or “unfairly powerful.” I spent hours playing Mega Man X and Zero, obsessed with mastering every boss pattern and finding hidden upgrades. Around the same time, I discovered game cheats and it felt like pure black magic. 
I genuinely believed there were digital sorcerers behind the scenes bending the rules of reality.

That early curiosity led me down the path of hacking, and eventually into offensive security. Today, watching people like IppSec pick apart systems with precision reminds me of that same feeling — turning the complex into something beautifully simple.

Whether you're here to learn, explore, or just satisfy your curiosity, I hope you find something valuable.
