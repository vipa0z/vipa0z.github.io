## Thanks for being here!
I’m vipa0z, an offensive security specialist passionate about red teaming, malware development, and low-level system exploitation.

Ever since I was a kid, I was drawn to anything that felt mysterious or “unfairly powerful.” I spent hours playing Mega Man Zero, obsessed with mastering every boss pattern and finding hidden upgrades. Around the same time, I discovered game cheats and it felt like pure black magic. I genuinely believed there were digital sorcerers behind the scenes bending the rules of reality.

That fascination with breaking systems and finding hidden paths evolved into a passion for understanding how things really work beneath the surface.
That drive naturally led me into exploit development and professional offensive security.
## My Approach
My philosophy is straightforward: assume nothing is secure, question everything, and always dig deeper. I focus on practical techniques that work in real-world scenarios, not just proof-of-concepts that look good on paper.
## What you will find here
Here you'll find my journey learning exploitation techniques, malware analysis, red team methodologies, and the occasional breakthrough moment when a concept finally clicks. I document what I'm learning in real-time, including the failures and rabbit holes that textbooks don't mention.

Whether you're a fellow security researcher, someone else starting their journey, or just curious about the darker corners of technology, I hope my learning process helps you think differently about security.
