## Thanks for being here!

I'm a Penetration Tester who loves digging into how systems work and finding creative ways to break them (for a good cause). My focus is on Securing Web Applications, APIs, Internal networks, and Active Directory. This blog is where I document my research, CTF writeups, and the things I learn along the way.

I'm always open to discussing security, collaboration, or new challenges. If you're looking for someone who is technically curious and driven by "how it works" under the hood, let's talk.

| **[Ligolo-NG](https://github.com/nicocha30/ligolo-ng)** (4.1k+ ⭐) | I contributed a usability improvement to ligolo-ng’s autoroute feature. The tool previously didn’t reflect the last-selected interface when rebinding pivot routes, which caused friction during multi-interface pivots. I added state persistence so operators can clearly see which interface was previously selected before binding tunnel addresses. |
