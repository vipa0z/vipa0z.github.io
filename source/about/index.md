### Hey This is Abdo
Thanks for being here! I’m Abdelrahman Magdy, also known as vipa00 — an offensive security specialist passionate about malware development, red teaming, and low-level system exploitation.

I love sharing what I learn through detailed CTF write-ups, exploit breakdowns, and practical security demonstrations.
I'm always pushing to expand my knowledge and give back to the security community. Whether you're here for technical insights or just curious about offensive security, I hope you find something valuable.
Looking forward to connecting and sharing more discoveries with you!
